# Chess Game

## Setup and Running the Game
- **Installation**: Before running the game, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- **Running the Game**: To start the game, execute `npm start` in the terminal. This command will start the development server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.
- **Environment Setup**: No specific environment setup is required beyond having Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Code Structure
- **Overview**: This chess game is structured into several main components:
  - `game.js`: serves as the entry point for the game. It initializes Phaser and sets up the main game scene.
  - `ChessScene.js`: defines the primary game scene and includes the logic for gameplay, such as moving pieces and checking for game over conditions.
  - `socket.js`: handles communication with the server using Socket.io.
  - Other modules may exist for handling UI, managing game state, etc.
- **Component Breakdown**: The key components/modules used in the game are:
  - `ChessScene`: Manages rendering and logic for the chess game, including player moves and game state management.
  - `Socket`: Facilitates real-time communication between clients for multiplayer functionality.
- **Design Decisions**: Phaser was chosen for its versatility and ease of use in game development, providing robust features for rendering and animation. Socket.io was selected to enable real-time multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other.
- **Dependencies**: The project relies on Phaser for game rendering and Socket.io for multiplayer communication.
